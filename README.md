# File Name Extractor

Extract a file's name without the dot + extension portion. 

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download the project's zip</li>
  <li>Compile the project</li>
  <li>Generate a jar library</li>
  <li>Add jar as external library reference</li>
</ol>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
Working on a previous project, I needed the ability to extract a file's name with and without the dot + extension, so I created a Java library that facilitates this task and uploaded to Github as a reference or potential library for others.

<h2>Info</h2>
This project does not contain any test cases.
